Climate change is bad. Climate change is hugely dangerous. But itâ€™s only one small segment of Earth Overshoot. ______________________________
From the viewpoint of the ecological footprint, climate change is not the core crisis. Instead, it is merely a symptom of overshoot, in which the waste gases of our overactive industries stockpile in the atmosphere and warm the planet. 
Biodiversity loss is another symptom of overshoot. As are soil degradation, deforestation, water scarcity, and more.
Although the United Nations climate secretariat has published blog posts about Earth overshoot, the subject has yet to appear in international agreements or national policies. ______________________________
This is not a secret. Our leaders have known about Earth Overshoot for more than half a century, for longer than some of you have been alive. And what have they done about it?
Nothing. Nothing at all, except continue with Business As Usual.

@Alephwyr  Reaching a "plateau" does no good at all. Because the debt, the annual amount of overshoot, would still continue accumulating year after year. We need to stop exceeding the limits. In fact, we need to reverse the trend and consume *less* than what Earth can replenish.
