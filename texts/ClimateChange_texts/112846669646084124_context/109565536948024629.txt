Daniel Smith and Trudeau "fighting climate wildfires" together. Its enough to make you laugh hystericaly while ugly sobbing.
Burn all the Oil Twins, out with their spades and fire hats.

One of the excuses for still burning carbon is carbon capture. To remove Canadas planned export is hoped to be only "dozens of trillions of dollars."
Thats before counting the damage, over decades. 
BCs cost of climate destruction over catatrophes there recently at 11 billion for one year, thats before counting the 600 deaths from heat.
And that was before Canada burning more trees than 3 centuries of logging over one "fire season."
