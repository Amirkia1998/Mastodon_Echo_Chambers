@NilaJones @markmalowany I think that's it. Grieving for Jasper, but also for my kids' futures, which are likely going to be so different from what I once imagined/hoped.
@Chigaze My son is, fortunately, pretty matter-of-fact about it already. He was just chatting with me, unprompted and casually, this morning: "There's a fire in Jasper. Houses are burning." And then he moved on to other topics: "Squirrels eat nuts."
