@dbattistella I thought those trucks were supposed to be good at offroading.
@dbattistella alt video. A large pickup  truck has run into a deep gap in the road cut by tea-brown water flowing heavily from right to left. Its tail end rests on the road. About 6 people and at least one police car stand in the road, all at a safe distance. The long straight road, bordered by a grassy swale and lush vegetation, extends from behind the truck to "infinity" just inside the upper right corner of the video frame. The ker-splash sound is a chunk of road falling into the stream.
