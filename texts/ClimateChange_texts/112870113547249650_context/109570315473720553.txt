I would say it would be challenging, for sure. But it could work.
My mentality is we need to change almost everything in our global system to prevent climate collapse. That a global tax couldn't work within our current system, isn't sufficient to say it won't work in future ones.
Our social systems will change and evolve over time, and we can't know what that will look like. I'm very much on favor of making progress where we can with a hope for better systems in the back of my mind.
@timaeus 
Unfortunately, I agree with you. I don't see us making meaningful changes until the costs are, catostrophically, slapping us in the face.
Still, I think there is much we can, and should, do to prepare ourselves for when that devastating opportunity arises. Discussing options (like this tax) and continuing to get the message out to folks about how bad it's likely to get are a start.

Power is such an interesting concept. These 100 families have pretty much unlimited power, until they don't. 
I'm not quite to the point of suggesting we ants rise up and overthrow the grasshoppers, but they do need to realize it's a credible threat for things to change, imo.
Regardless, we ants need to come together because united, we will be the ones with power. Which is why so much is spent on trying to divide us.
@NatureMC 
That's huge. Momentum is building!

Bummer. Yeah it's very easy to backtrack on big goals like that. Got to keep pushing our governments for better in all the ways we can.
