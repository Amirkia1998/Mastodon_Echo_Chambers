@dan613 @petergleick It seems that the doomers are "winning" the message battle. They just don't actually seem interested in actually helping to solve the problems by building political will for climate action as much as like to fear monger.
@jaystephens @dan613 @petergleick Yes, but the people that want to delay climate action by denying climate science switched a significant proportion of their political technology campaign from outright denial to "it's too late to do anything anyways" messaging so they're winning in a large part because they have a much larger budget to push their agenda than do those of us that want to get people to take climate action.
