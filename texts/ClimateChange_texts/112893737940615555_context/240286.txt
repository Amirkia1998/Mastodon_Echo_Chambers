@GreenFire @dan613 @petergleick They're winning in part because a simple message beats the messy complex reality in the battle of ideas quite often. One of our best responses is to break the complexity into simple parts and blast those in response. Another is the old-school truth sandwich, deployed like "X can help mitigate AGW, which is not a pointless thing like A has claimed, because mitigation via X is effective as shown by [link].
@GreenFire @dan613 @petergleick No disagreement there. The money has walked the "deny problem > claim science isn't settled > admit it's real but deny human agency > admit reality but say it's too late now" pathway all too predictably, and is making a more effective last stand than expected ğŸ˜¥
