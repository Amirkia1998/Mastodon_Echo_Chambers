When the insurance industry folds, we will, but it will be called another GFC, this time on steroids.  Either insurers raise rates, and lose customers or pullout of markets and lose customers, but the results are the same:
Homes, businesses and communities are battered by frequent damage and destruction and people lose insurance. Property (business and housing) lose value, lending implodes. Itâ€™s a debt deflation crisis.

People may be indifferent to climate pollution disasters, but nowhere is untouched. Itâ€™s global and a delusion to image thereâ€™s a safe place where everything will be the same.

Folks in Vermont etc are not spared.
PBS Tera has a piece on this topic how flood risk assessment is wrong.
@gdeihl @breadandcircuses 
Itâ€™s everywhere. Insurance is like collagen, holding the various bits of economic infrastructure and wealth together.

If they can supply a source of information to document the issue, Iâ€™d love to see a link to it.
@jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses @gdeihl 
I can imagine. I might also suggest that if the substance of this information can be had publicly (buried in financial statements etc) and the program can be named, it should be. 
Fire hazard is an acute issue for those of us in the US West.
An outfit named First Street has been producing maps related to fire risk, which some of the insurance industry has sought. State Farm is one such insurer.
I donâ€™t know if the Fed has any authority tho.

In the sense that Carol refers to information individuals in the banking system are seeing that tells them it's in trouble
@jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses @gdeihl 
The Fed is supposed to run stress tests on the banking system. I suppose that would be the lever they could exercise against banks, but they are victim (so to speak) to the insurance industry the Fed has no authority over.
I have the sense that an extreme weather insurance crisis will force the federal government, or municipalities to grapple with thousands, if not millions of bad loans and in devalued properties in the wake of such a crisis.
@gdeihl @jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses 
The icing on the cake is interest rates don't slow down the economy necessarily, because they fatten interest income.
Those that benefit from it, namely banks and the rich, enjoy a burst of income and a buffer from rising prices. It fattens up stock market activity and also stimulates the economy this way, but there are large portions of the population who must suffer austerity as their burdens increase.

I dunna know if QE is a way out. :ablobcatknitsweats: 
The essential difference is extreme weather destroys property, while the GFC resulted from obscene profits by applying CDOs to loan risk.
Banks were printing money (issuing home loans) in order to profit from the fantasy they had abolished risk.
