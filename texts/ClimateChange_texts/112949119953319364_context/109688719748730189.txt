@GhostOnTheHalfShell @breadandcircuses I'm living in the midst of the delusion, the Northeast US that is relatively spared so far. Pure luck. No doubt this will impact everyone, regardless.
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @breadandcircuses Yeah, well aware of Vermont. I've spent considerable time there, living in upstate NY. Now I'm in Western NY.
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @breadandcircuses Yes, insurance is going to be a huge issue, that's just begun. I've been thinking about the heavy insurance farms need to carry. The problem extends well beyond homeowners.
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses The fire situation in the west, Pacific northwest and Canadian boreal is only going to get worse. People should be getting evacuated out of harms way if there was any honesty, and we spent the military budget on something just.
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses I don't understand the question. What information and documentation?
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses All the Fed seems to do is control interest rates to the punitive detriment of the average person to protect the industry that is destroying the planet. The Fed has no clue. The whole system based on extracting fossil fuels is on the verge of implosion. Those at the top of the food chain don't see the truth, or will hide it as long as they possibly can.
@GhostOnTheHalfShell @jawarajabbi @breadandcircuses Yes, there are two economies, one for me and you, and one for them.
@Threadbane @breadandcircuses Too bad everyone wasn't. We'd be in a much better place in every way.
@mrjonno @breadandcircuses @KimSJ @TheGuardian The only people who think this is a good thing are the oligarchs and the ignorant. Strange bed fellows, indeed. All of us aren't going to make it. I'd rather die fighting than whimpering. Environmental activists are getting long prison sentences. This is what we're up against.
@Cyclist @breadandcircuses Sadly I agree, but until I lose all hope I will try to fight and inform It needs to be impressed on Harris and Walz just how dire the situation we're in is with the bold assumption they're going to beat Trump. An open letter to them is on my mind. We need radical changes fast to have a chance. https://geoffreydeihl.substack.com/p/no-fury-like-a-planet-scorned
@breadandcircuses Thank you for promoting my latest. I wonder if I'll ever have the opportunity to write something positive?
@breadandcircuses Lol. Thanks. I'm having my head cryogenically frozen and attached to an android body. No worries.
@violetmadder @breadandcircuses Sure. Disaster capitalism at its finest. One last feeding frenzy. What will they do when we're gone?
