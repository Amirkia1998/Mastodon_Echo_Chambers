@largess @CelloMomOnCars greed is a powerful motivator and telling people that they must stop being greedy and not make money is a hard road that will take more time than we have. Transitioning to low carbon economies is also hard but provides an opportunity for other greedy people to push it along. At the moment, the transition is more likely to succeed.
