@ingalls kind of why I moved to northern MN, about 25 miles away as the crow flies from the Canadian border.  Worse places to hang out during the catastrophe.  I'll be gone before mid century.
@gwaldby I can thoroughly understand the black flies.  They got me good this year.  But I grew up in New Orleans, another mosquito haven, so those buggers don't drive me as crazy...I have strategies for them.  
I usually mostly hibernate during June, though.  LOL.
@ingalls Closer to your dad than you are, but I'm over in the Arrowhead in the Boundary Waters area.  Cool that you have an MN connection!
