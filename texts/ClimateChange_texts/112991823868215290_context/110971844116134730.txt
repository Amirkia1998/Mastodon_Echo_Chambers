Memories of walking on a makeshift bridge of wooden poles, that then snapped. Memories of cows on roofs, and people trying to get them down. Using cardboard boxes as makeshift boats, that floated at first but then began to sink, and many other poorly thought out ideas. 
The only thing that saved us all then, was that we were a fishing town, and there were plenty of boats to go around, as people rose to the occasion.
@forrest Times like these I really wish I was a journalist, with a camera, so I could cover these properly.
