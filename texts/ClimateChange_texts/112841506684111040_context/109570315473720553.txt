Great question! I had to look it up. Good news is it's due to geography, not bias for the global north.
"This is because the seasonal patterns of the northern hemisphere drive the overall global temperatures. The large land masses of the northern hemisphere warm up faster than the oceans of the southern hemisphere can cool down during the northern summer months."

Ha. I haven't seen that comic, but it sums it up nicely. 
Not to mention another aspect of climate change is increased variability. More extreme extremes. 
I'm sure if I've looked hard enough we'd find the hands of fossil fuel marketing on the phrase "so much for global warming." I doubt they were the first to use the phrase, but there is no chance they haven't helped promote the use of it.
