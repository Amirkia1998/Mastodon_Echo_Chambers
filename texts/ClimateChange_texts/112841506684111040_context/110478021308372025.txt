Is it still global if the graph seems to show seasonality? Perhaps the cycle varies with distance from the sun too, but that graph seems to reflect the cycle of a single hemisphere, the northern hemisphere (I know, it is the change from the former mean that is important, just questioning the use of ‘global’ for data that seems hemisphere specific)

That makes sense I think, ocean currents and whatnot, I suppose.
Oh land masses. Perfect sense.
