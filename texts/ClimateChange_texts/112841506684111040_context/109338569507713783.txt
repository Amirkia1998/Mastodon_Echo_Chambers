Nerd out: the butterfly effect is swapping from one wing to another, or flipping all over the place.

The analogy I came up with a decade ago was the kind of transition in the kind of bubbles in a pan. Compare and contrast a pan at simmer vs rolling boil. The temp isn’t that different, but the state is, at least if you’re some little mote hoping for a quiet life with mild disruptions here and there.

About 7% more moisture payload per degree IIRC Drier dries and bigger deluges, more often and over wider areas, and swinging between those extremes.
