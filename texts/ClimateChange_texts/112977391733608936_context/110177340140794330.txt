@CelloMomOnCars So, let me get this straight, you're boycotting A, B, and C, because you can't stand your money supporting _______ but you just bought a new gas car?
@CelloMomOnCars Sorry CelloMom, I was addressing unknown others who remind me of the many things I need to boycott, while locking in their own gasoline purchases for a decade. I was not referring to you individually!What Iâ€™m saying here is that burning gasoline is not only harmful to our planet, but also shovels money directly at the most repugnant members of our society, who will use it to harm us. Therefore, purchasing a gas car is a commitment to funding the people who would destroy us.
