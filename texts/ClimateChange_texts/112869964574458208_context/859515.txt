@davidzipper Really glad to see this article, more officials need to call DOTs on their environmental BS.
The traffic engineering world and the construction industry surrounding it seems to exist in a reality-free bubble where humans never respond to incentives or changed circumstances, and yet those so-called traffic engineers will swear that what they do is backed by data, even as they ignore repeated results that refute their own predictions.
