@RARohde #AltText: a line graph of mean global temperature from Jan-Dec on the x axis and from 11°C to about 17.5°C on the y axis. There are many lines, ranging from the year 1850 to 2024. The lines are a bell curve peaking around July. Over time, the line shifts up and the most recent peaks are at least 1°C hotter than the oldest. In red, the line for 2023 overtakes the others in May and stays well above 2022. 2024, in black, has been hotter than 2023 for the entire year so far.
