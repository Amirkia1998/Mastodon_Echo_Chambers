@stephanie I am in a clay-heavy zone so after our 12th hour of rain, it can’t absorb anymore so the gardens look like lakes! Kinda worried where this next deluge is going to go… hopefully not over my patio ledge!!!
@aggualaqisaaq On local a Radio, a weather expert said our summer weather will now behave like Tennessee or Louisiana due to pattern and pressure changes over midwest US and the Atlantic ocean… sigh…
