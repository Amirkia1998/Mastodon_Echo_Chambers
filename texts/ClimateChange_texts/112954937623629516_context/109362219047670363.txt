(Unfortunately for introverts like me, they already have enough people writing postcards to voters; I'm working to convince myself that my fear of climate change is bigger than my fear of talking to a stranger).

Did you read the article tho?It says Harris doesn't *have* to emphasise her record or plans on climate change because everybody already knows that Trump is going to turn on the fossil fuel spigot on full blast, while she has helped put "Biden's" climate law in place.
@tmstreet 
At least she picked the climate action guy not the guy who hasn't tried very hard to stop fracking in his state.But I hear you.
