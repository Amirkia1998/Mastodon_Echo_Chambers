@Chigaze probably because the effects of climate change are not restricted to this province nor the difficulty of navigating the healthcare system.
@Chigaze also true. But Vancouver and Ontario's affordability issues are not strictly due to Alberta's shortsighted economic policies.
I will push back against any discussion of climate change effects as a locally exclusive situation--the whole point is that the commons is being slowly destroyed. California gets suffocated by woodsmoke same as any other locality.
@Chigaze no arguments on Alberta's tax policies.
