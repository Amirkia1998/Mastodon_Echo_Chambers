So as this was the CBC Edmonton AM talking point I texted it to them as input. They never read it even though they didn't have too many responses on the topic…
 #climateChange #alberta #smoke
@msroest This was from the CBC Edmonton talking point this morning and to be fair it was focussed on MacLeans piece that has Edmonton as one of the most affordable cities in Canada. A bunch of the responses talked about low taxes in Alberta and that's what got me. Yes Alberta has low taxes but we're paying for that in other ways.
@distinct The effects are everywhere but the causes are more localized. The "Alberta Advantage" is founded on using resource revenue to keep taxes (business and personal) low and now the UCP is actively killing carbon free alternatives. 
With healthcare, the issues aren't unique to Alberta but that doesn't mean shouldn't talk about the causes in our own context… which are underfunding caused by our dependence on a volatile revenue source.
@distinct What I was responding to was about Alberta on a local Alberta radio program. It was not a discussion about the affordability issue in other provinces. 
Also I never said anything about localized effects. I mentioned climate change because Alberta is a CAUSE because we lean on fossil fuel revenue to keep taxes down.
@virtuous_sloth @Yup_Its_Holly @soc_i_ety The chart is labelled as the 2023 average and it was indeed that high in Alberta for the floating rates.
