@ethicalrevolution I don't think it's necessarily a case of not being aware of the need for change, but not knowing what is a useful thing to do to help. For example I tried to go vegan as a student in response to learning about the issues of animal agriculture. I was broke, had no time and didn't know a great deal about a healthy diet, I ate chips and peanut butter sandwiches for a week and a half then felt so awful I gave up. I tried again five years ago, and because this time I knew how to
@ethicalrevolution cook and could afford fresh food it stuck. The typical British diet is very meat heavy and a lot of people seem to go vegan by just leaving out the meat and not substituting it with any other protein. likewise most people probably know they should be using their cars less, but with no safe bike infrastructure or reliable public transport have no choice. I think greenwash plays a big role in peoples' continued willingness to fly though, a lot of people do seem to believe
@ethicalrevolution that sustainable aviation fuels exist, offsetting works or the impact of flying isn't actually that big
@ethicalrevolution ah okay, I was interpreting "unaware of the science" as meaning "unaware of the problem" and thinking you needed an extra category for "aware of the problem but unaware of actions you could personally take to mitigate it, or of how to carry out those actions"
@ethicalrevolution thank you!
@ethicalrevolution but yeah it's definitely a lot easier nowadays, not just because of information but because there are more sort of "starter vegan" meat substitutes available. You don't have to jump straight to knowing how to make a lentil curry, you can just substitute a This Isn't sausage for a pork one then learn the more different recipes as you go
