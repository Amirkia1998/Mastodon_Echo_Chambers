"The CDCâ€™s estimate of #HeatDeaths, about 1,200 Americans a year, is probably at least a tenfold undercount. An estimate from several years ago was that, in the U.S., there are actually in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 heat-related deaths, and that is likely higher today."

@Lyle 
It's pretty scary.The 12,000 heat deaths per year is still lower than the 20,000 deaths from gun murders, but heat deaths will be rising as climate change really kicks in.
It shows you that climate change is violence:it's less clear when the "weapon" is extreme weather, but it is violence nevertheless.
