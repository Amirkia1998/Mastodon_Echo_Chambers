The new #orchard that I am building, is surrounded by fruit trees, peach, cherry, pears, and apples. I added 31 fruit trees to the center, as with the lower orchard, they will be pruned yearly to develop lead branches to keep and no further upper growth is allowed. You get a person height fruit tree, that you can pick without a ladder. Also, strong winds break talker trees. The hedge is all grapevine. Either a tree produces fruit or flowers, or I replace it. @thepoliticalcat
When I say, we're surrounded by the #ocean , I mean literally.Seasonal high tides, moon phase, and storm surge, go right up my ditch to create my own 'moat' effect. Along the shores, apples grow well, but some hurricane season surge pushed my apple trees over, and I propped it back up, and it produces still. I used the high moisture area to start my first willow tree too. @thepoliticalcat
@KissAnne  I got my feet wet pruning the apple tree this morning. The tide was right to the apple tree
@MAJ1 she's still in pain, naturally, and uncomfortable and grumpy that she can't do anything all summer.
@elliek gonna be pears in bottles this winter
@LJ @thepoliticalcat I learned everything as I go, and I'm told you want lateral branches. If they tend to be you can hang water bottles on the end to weight them down so they grow laterally.So I bought a foot up from the trunk, I have four older branches. I take off any new limbs that grow upward, and try to expose the center to light. Trees have the tendency to clutter the center, keeping light from the other side
