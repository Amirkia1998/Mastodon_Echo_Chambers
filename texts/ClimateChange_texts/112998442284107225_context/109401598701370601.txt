Good morning, Rasta! We have a pear tree and 2 apple trees. The second apple tree is to replace the one that was planted by the original owners back in the late 1950s. Of course, we live on the edge of a city, so we could never plant so many trees. I am enjoying your tips on tree care. I think I'll take some notes and share them with my husband. I hope your wife is doing okay and that her pain is subsiding.Have a good day!
