It almost seems like the entire legal system is stacked in favor of BigOil. People are getting heavy sentences for merely talking about peaceful protests and now organizations may get sued out of existence. 
Odd that the legal system favors the rich and powerful few. It would be pretty bad if the rest of society was structured that way too.
