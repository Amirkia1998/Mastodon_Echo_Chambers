@ethicalrevolution I’ve flown once in the last 20 years. I’m over 95% vegan. I do what I can in other regards but it’s not enough and should do more

@ethicalrevolution glad you enjoyed it :)
FYI: The host, @Eceni is on here
@ethicalrevolution same :) @Eceni
@ethicalrevolution for me, polls usually get very low engagement. Fewer than 10 votes is the norm
