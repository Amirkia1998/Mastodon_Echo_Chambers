🤔 Genuine question: When the #science overwhelmingly tells us that our existing lifestyle choices will lead to huge sacrifices for the lives of our own children and future descendants, which category do you fall in to in justifying continuing to: fly; eat meat & dairy; buy unnecessary stuff; etc?

Come on people! Nobody is being judged. It’s a genuine question looking for genuine answers. I posted this 40 minutes ago and the poll has had SIX responses. There is no way only six people have seen it. Is this the cognitive dissonance that @heptag0n mentioned in the comments in action?
@heptag0n I fear this is the correct answer for most.
A combination of us humans being both creatures of habit and being unable to put enough weight between cause and effect to make radical change.
@Wifiwits @heptag0n If the majority of people lived like you it would certainly not be tinkering around the edges. This is what I want to understand here: How do we get more people being like you in the short time we have?
@Wifiwits @heptag0n Do we not know what to do? On the options in my original question (few of many possible ones:
Do eat meat/Don’t eat meat (and everything in between).
Buy more/Buy less.
Keep flying / Don’t fly.
On those alone we ‘know’ what to do in terms of what is going to be part of any kind of solution, right?
@Wifiwits @heptag0n Anything any individual does alone is going to be tinkering around the edges. When each of our individual actions is taken collectively then the tinkering becomes tankering!
@nutmeg Two things I need a little more info to understand what you mean here, if I may?
We simply don’t what? 
Which (of the admittedly very few of the possible choices I could have used) are not necessary?
@nutmeg Oh, I see what you mean by ‘we don’t’ now. 👍
Yes, the poll may not be applicable to all. But for anyone who it is I’m genuinely looking for answers (and ultimately solutions).
So, given where you are (and others reading this will be) how do we get those many millions to join you?
@urlyman You do a lot more than the majority of us, but you are in the extreme minority. How can we ever get to a point where enough people are more like you? Or do we simply accept we won’t?
@urlyman Power structures are of course an issue and we shouldn’t stop challenging them, but there’s no way those in power will make the moves required in the little time we have.
@urlyman Super episode. Lovely to hear my former* Fromie friend, Peter referenced. Have subscribed to the pod. 👍
*Former in that I no longer live there!
@urlyman @Eceni Amazing, thanks. Lovely to meet you both today. 👍
@debe I’d go so far as to say it’s impossible to be perfect, not just hard. As I said in another reply: You do a lot more than the majority of us, but you are in the extreme minority. How can we ever get to a point where enough people are more like you?
@debe There is so much good stuff happening, it’s true. I make a point of reading @PositiveNewsUK to find out some of it and stay positive, but let’s be honest, we’ve already impacted the future and it’s getting worse each and every day that passes.
@debe Mad isn’t it. Shifted the earth’s tilt!
@debe I was going to respond with ‘Billion dollar question’, but it’s way more than that. More like future of humanity question.
@afewbugs Aye, so the answer for any of those people to the poll is option 1: ‘unaware of the science’. Trouble is how do you know you’re unaware if you’re unaware?
@afewbugs Wow. You felt compelled enough to make a huge change even though you didn’t really know how to do it. Well done for finally making it. I suppose nowadays it’s a lot easier with so much more info available on good, healthy diets etc.
@MythingPerson I think other is probably the answer I want to see the most with the comments such as these included. Just to get a greater understanding. I want us to find solutions. I want to know how I convince my good friend, who flies all over the world an insane amount but is also an incredibly caring human being, to change. Same for many other good friends/family members for same and differing behaviours. I think I do anyway. I mean I don’t know. It’s impossible to be perfect so how far do you go. Is doing one thing ok but not another? My previous mindset was that if we each do better today than we did yesterday in any small way then that’s good. But now it seems the urgency is too great and without radical action our future generations are facing hideous consequences.
@MythingPerson Yeh .. it’s demoralising. We all feel we have a right to see every corner of the earth if we earn enough money to do so. We are conditioned to think we should. Tourists go to Antarctica now. Ufffff.
@MythingPerson It’s so hard.
@kawentzmann Go on…
