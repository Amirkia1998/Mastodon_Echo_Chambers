@robcornelius This is not an election where “either one works.” The biggest USA climate action proposed and implemented was the IRA in 2022, a Democratic action with some bipartisan support.
@robcornelius You’re right there hasn’t been much economic incentive to repair climate, but I see that as changing slowly. And of course we can all do things just because it’s for the good. Love those pithy sayings from you Brits! 😀
@carolannie I missed the Comments by Frost, but it was downplayed or not mentioned by most of the people speaking. I understand the reasons— first woo swing state voters and get elected.
@carolannie Yes, I know the intention is there, but found it odd there was so little mention overall. Otherwise it was a great DNC event! (I quit NYT subscription too. )
