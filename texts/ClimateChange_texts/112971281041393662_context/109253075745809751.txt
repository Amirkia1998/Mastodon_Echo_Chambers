@Snowshadow Wait, @sorlud was laughing at the fire????
@Snowshadow 2 followers in 2 years. Yeah, @sorlud gets the boot for being rude to you, to the victims of the fire (all of us), and for thinking anything about the fire was "funny".

@Snowshadow Oh, I see I have the domain blocked. Why do I even see this account? Well, it's blocked too
@Snowshadow Swell.
@PandaChronicle I'm so sorry!! I got a brief taste of it when we had to evacuate a few years ago, and spend the night at our kids' place. I remember at 3 am, when we got the order to go, we were in the car, I looked back and saw a red wall of fire encroaching. Terrifying. 
Our house was fine, but it smelled like smoke for days.@Snowshadow
@PandaChronicle How awful. It's so damn scary and all too common now. @Snowshadow
@luv_wins TY! That was years ago. @PandaChronicle @Snowshadow
