@Snowshadow @sorlud@mastodon.scot @GottaLaff Having once lost my home in a fire, I can assure you that it’s not funny. 29 years later I am still traumatized by it. It’s an awful thing to experience.
@Snowshadow Rightly so (terror of fire).With almost 3 decades of hindsight, it pushed me in some good directions, though I don’t recommend it as a motivational experience. It was not nearly as traumatic as having your whole community destroyed by fire. I am very careful now, have a hard time with candles & fireworks. I got masses of help & support in the months after the fire. Having my community come out to help made it a far less terrible experience than it might have been.
@Snowshadow I unplug everything when I’m not using it, stay in the kitchen when stuff is on the stove.
@Snowshadow All good advice! Especially about the pot lid. I hadn’t thought of that.
@GottaLaff @Snowshadow That must have been terrifying. Friends of mine lived just outside Paradise CA, were lucky the fire did not jump the highway within a mile of their place. Friends of theirs were not so lucky. They kept their camper packed up and ready to grab the cats and go during fire season. They no longer live there.
