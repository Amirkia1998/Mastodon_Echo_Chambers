it is beyond despicable Danielle Smith is now begging for Canadian military, who are not trained to fight wildfires (but can support logistics) after she slashed fire budgets for training, hiring and equipment, and as she attacks the federal gov every waking moment, kills climate efforts, threatens to withhold taxes and shills to big oil driving the climate crisis

Folks, brace yourself - this is really, really bad, Jasper is almost fully engulfed. This is about an hour ago - Maligne lodge in flames, Petro Can station gone

@lolonurse crap, that's truly awful, so sorry - for so many communities this is now the reality
@jfmezei well, that's true, but Jasper town itself is municipal fire, and Parks Canada crews will call on provinces of course when things get out of hand - Alberta obviously can't adequately respond, so it's really the province at fault here not being prepared IMO
@LauraleeDukeshire had a feeling this was happening when the Jasper incident commanders said they were evacuating the remaining emergency crews from the town - they wouldn't do that if there was any chance of saving the town
@Scienceisnotopinions local fire had to self evacuate just after that photo was taken - if the town isn't gone, it will be soon 
so sad, horrific for all the families who called Jasper home
I know it well, grew up in Calgary, we visited almost every summer
