@CelloMomOnCars A lot of people in the west say they are in favour of action to fight climate change, and might even believe they are in favour of such action, but only in an abstract way. When confronted with action that affects personal privilege and lifestyle, they suddenly become less supportive of such action.
@CelloMomOnCars So true.
@seanjhurley @CelloMomOnCars Sadly so true. Most people are selfish assholes.
