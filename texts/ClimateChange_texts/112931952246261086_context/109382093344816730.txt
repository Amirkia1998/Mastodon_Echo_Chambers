@CelloMomOnCars I noticed this early on and I am afraid she is triangulating.  This won't change my vote, of course, but makes me sad.
@CelloMomOnCars This wasn't based on the article but the fact that she is running away from her anti fracking stance in Pennsylvania due to its heavy reliance on natural gas and fracking.  I could not access the article. Yes, realpolitik probably demands this but it still makes me sad that we can't have a full throated endorsement on the climate crisis.  We are also setting records in fossil fuel production despite the good things with respect to IRA, etc.
@CelloMomOnCars Good point
