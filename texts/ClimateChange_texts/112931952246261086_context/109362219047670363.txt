In this Pew poll, "Dealing with climate change" is #18 of 20 priorities Americans were asked about.I think that's simply because few people have connected the dots between climate change and issues that they care about. 
For instance, climate change has a huge toll on the economy, on healthcare costs,  and it's worst for poor people of color.

This nugget from Mark Gongloff:
"Just as two-thirds of us worry about #ClimateChange, two-thirds of us say we rarely or never discuss it with our friends or family. Maybe we don’t talk about climate change now, but nothing is stopping us. The more we normalize talking about it, the likelier we are to actually do something about it. "

8 million environmental voters skipped the 2020 presidential election.
"Nathaniel Stinnett [of the #EnvironmentalVoterProject] explains why increasing voter participation is essential to advancing the climate movement and shows how his team is mobilizing millions of new environmental voters — without talking about #ClimateChange at all."

(Unfortunately for introverts like me, they already have enough people writing postcards to voters; I'm working to convince myself that my fear of climate change is bigger than my fear of talking to a stranger).
@Jgmeadows 
You have a point.Many people also don't see the connection between climate change and things that affect them personally, e.g. inflation in the grocery bills, and that their "lifestyle" is already being affected, e.g. if you have to stay indoors because of wildfire smoke.
We have a lot of dots to connect, see my reply to the post above.
@tmstreet 
Did you read the article tho?It says Harris doesn't *have* to emphasise her record or plans on climate change because everybody already knows that Trump is going to turn on the fossil fuel spigot on full blast, while she has helped put "Biden's" climate law in place.
@tmstreet 
At least she picked the climate action guy not the guy who hasn't tried very hard to stop fracking in his state.But I hear you.
@chu 
Precisely!
