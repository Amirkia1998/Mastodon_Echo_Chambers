But "peak fossil fuel" is not a thing: There is in fact way more fossil fuel in the ground than suffices to completely muck up the climate. Also way, way more than we need to make plastics, fertiliser, shampoo, and such, thereby thoroughly poisoning the biome. 
For many reasons: leave it in the ground.

Maybe you need to look at recent updated data. We're either at or just past peak fossil fuel demand. It goes down from here.
