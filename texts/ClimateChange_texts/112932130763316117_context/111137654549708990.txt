@StarkRG @breadandcircuses Yes - & no. We have rather less agency over social change than you suppose. Society isn't some machine that can be fixed if it goes wrong, like a car. There are many things wrong with our societies (plural) for a start; & they are too organic & complex for any mechanistic analogy to hold. Furthermore, we're part of them, & we're part of the problem. We can't abstract ourselves from our societies & treat them with genuine objectivity.
@StarkRG The nukes may well get launched, but I don't recommend that as a course of action.
@StarkRG Explain, please, how "society" gets changed. Societies aren't static - they change over time. British society now isn't like it was in the 1990s, or 1970s, even if there is such a thing as "British society", & that's arguable.
@StarkRG If you want to change society, perhaps you need to think about how society changes, & what sort of change is possible, as well as what change(s) you think might be desirable. That requires knowledge of history, sociology, politics & economics. Oh, & ecology, too! That one's a must.
