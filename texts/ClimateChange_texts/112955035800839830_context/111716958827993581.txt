@CoedCadw the streets of Berlin are lined with huge trees and the back yards are full of them also. It looks nice and really helps in the summer.
@CoedCadw and look how beautiful it looks out of my current window.
@CoedCadw not me, sadly.  Just visiting my mum.
@jfparis @CoedCadw maybe water condensing out of it?
