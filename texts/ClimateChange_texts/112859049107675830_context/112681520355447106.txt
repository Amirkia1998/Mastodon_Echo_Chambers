@aroom @elmo I love you’re enthusiasm but unless we change the law, I don’t think we can stop her….
@aroom @elmo you’ve taken this post the wrong way. I use paper straws, I refuse plastic bags and make sustainable choices. It’s just a sad reality that even with all of us doing our part, one stupid decision like this undoes thousands of good ones.
@elmo @aroom it’s definitely made some difference 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 
But you’re right, you going without while the 1% destroys the planet using the resources of the 99% is the real issue.
Yet, it seems like it will never change.
What are we hoping for? The discovery of free non polluting energy?
If we do that we will just end up predicting more waste…. Humans solve one problem and create a new one 😅#progress
@aroom @elmo @nutmeg totally agree! The reality is our success as a species is very nuanced. There is no easy answer. Unfortunately, polarising posts like this are the only way to bring attention to the issues. But hey, at least we are talking about now ✊🏼
@elmo @nutmeg 100%. Although we all have a carbon footprint, our feet just aren’t as big as entire industries. Yet, I still use my paper straw and refuse a plastic bag 💪🏻
