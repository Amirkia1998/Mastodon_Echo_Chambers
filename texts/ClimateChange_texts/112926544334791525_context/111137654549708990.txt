@breadandcircuses No matter how much stick I get for it, I will go on reiterating that you can't have economic degrowth without demographic (population) degrowth. We have a global capitalist economy - not some ideal ecosocialist one. It requires perpetual annual economic growth - & perpetual annual population growth, because it needs more consumers, even when it doesn't need more workers!
@breadandcircuses It will eventually collapse - it HAS to do so, because it is unsustainable. But there is no guarantee that what replaces it will be a better system. It is far more likely to be worse!
@zir4n @breadandcircuses No, you haven't followed my argument at all. Ten-spined sticklebacks manage their relationship with ecology so much better than humans. When their food supply is abundant, they have babies; when it isn't, they don't - but they like sex, so they all turn gay until equilibrium is restored, & they can start having babies again. Does it not occur to you that climate change, biodiversity loss & environmental degradation might have an impact on human food & water supplies?
