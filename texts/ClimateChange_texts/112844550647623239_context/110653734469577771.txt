Folks, brace yourself - this is really, really bad, Jasper is almost fully engulfed. This is about an hour ago - Maligne lodge in flames, Petro Can station gone

@lolonurse crap, that's truly awful, so sorry - for so many communities this is now the reality
@jfmezei well, that's true, but Jasper town itself is municipal fire, and Parks Canada crews will call on provinces of course when things get out of hand - Alberta obviously can't adequately respond, so it's really the province at fault here not being prepared IMO
