But at least #capitalism and markets ensure "efficient" production and allocation of resources.
Sure, some may starve, but only the least deserving. See, "deserving" is determined by wealth. Those with less wealth deserve less of the bounties of this earth.
Which is the same logic behind "efficiency" (according to economists) which is defined largely based on willingness to pay for goods.
I wish that was sarcasm, or a joke. Clearly, this is not a just system.
