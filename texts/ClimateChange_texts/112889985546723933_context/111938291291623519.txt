@Bentley The effects aren't linear. 0.1℃ now causes more damage than 0.1℃ a decade ago. Conversely, 0.1℃ prevented now has a much greater benefit and cost savings than 0.1℃ prevented in a decade.
Unfortunately, the people who write this crap are only concerned about the next fiscal quarter. They plan to be retired and rich in the next decade. Either that or they have really undervalued their souls.
