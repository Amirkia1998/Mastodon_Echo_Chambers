One of the researchers, Philippe Ciais, offered a summary of their findings, using slightly less scientific language that is perhaps easier for laypersons to understand. 
Here is part of what he wrote‚Ä¶_________________________________
Even if 2023 was a transition from a La Ni√±a (good for carbon sinks) to a moderate El Ni√±o, we see a sudden drop of the land carbon sink from extreme warming and Amazon mega-drought. In fact, the northern land sink appears to have declined by 50% since 2015 from droughts, while the tropics were a sink during the recent cool and wet La Ni√±a from 2020 to mid 2023 and turned to a source in 2023 with a modest El Ni√±o. 
The decline of the northern sink was masked by good conditions in the tropics absorbing CO2, but in the coming years if this decline continues, we may see a rapid acceleration of CO2 and global warming which was unforeseen in future climate models projections._________________________________

And finally, here is a brief recap of what I think it all means:
Until recently, the huge amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans, by soils, and by plants have prevented massive rapid global heating. But those systems are changing. For the first time, 2023 showed that land sinks are not absorbing nearly as much CO2. 
As the world continues getting warmer, carbon sinks will absorb less CO2, which means more CO2 emissions are ending up in the atmosphere. This may vary from year to year with ENSO (La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o cycles), but the overall picture is way out of line with standard predictions for future climate change. 
In other words, it‚Äôs even worse than we thought. 
That's assuming, of course, that the conclusions of this paper are correct. Maybe we'll get lucky and find out they're wrong.
@geonz  Yep. Even if human commerce and industry stops increasing emissions, CO2 in the atmosphere might still continue to climb faster and faster.
