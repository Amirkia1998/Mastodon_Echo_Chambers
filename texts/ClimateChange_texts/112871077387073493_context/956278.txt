@KeithDJohnson The heterodox economist Professor Steve Keen posits - and demonstrates - that much of that 'lack of political will' can be laid at the feet of the dominant (Neoclassical) economic paradigm.I find his argument compelling. If you care to view a brief synopsis I recommend this lecture:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LvyxH3O7kE&t=39s

@KeithDJohnson My pleasure. I've had the great good fortune to attend a lecture series which he started to develop a manuscript that was to have been published early next year. The entity behind that effort has gone under. Members of our seminar received a draft; I consider it revolutionary. Steve has moved on and is both working on a new book and trying to find a buyer for Ravel, his system-dynamics & double-entry bookkeeping-based economics graphing program. Seeing it in action is amazing!
@KeithDJohnson Thanks! I now watch his channel more than I do music videos!
@KeithDJohnson Yes, so would I! Happy to keep you posted...
@KeithDJohnson Thanks for all of these. I listened to the new Debunking Economics this morning: It's about how mainstream econ doesn't include energy as a factor of production - and how unforgivably stupid that is! As he is fond of saying: "Capital without energy is a statue; labor without energy is a corpse." Using the previously mentioned Ravel, he demonstrates a near 1-to-1 correspondence between GDP and energy.
