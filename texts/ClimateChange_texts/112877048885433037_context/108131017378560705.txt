@Nonilex Fuck him. It is not a child's job to make a better man out of an asshole. Or a better person out of a parent, period.
You want better men, JD Vance? First, BECOME ONE. Second, invest money in education & community. This is the burden of YOUR lack of responsibility and empathy. Stop dumping it on the backs of women and children.

@mooseandriosmom @Nonilex Vance, Trump, Johnson, Blackburn, Taylor Green, Boebert, Abbott, Noem, Graham, Huckabee Sanders, Hagerty, Scott, Tuberville, Gaetz, Stitt, Jordan, deSantis, so many others: all tossing this nation directly into a boiling pot of authoritarianism, nationalism, militarism, elitism, and fascism. Every last one of them needs to be removed from power without possibility of return.
@Ralph058 @mooseandriosmom @Nonilex I hope he takes every last one of them down with him.
@bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex I think with "incels," it comes down to never having learned to make a genuine emotional connection with another human, no matter what type of relationship. Something in childhood was missing or never got fully developed --  resulting in a severe attachment disorder and leading to a sense of entitlement as well as a lack of empathy.
That's what's broken about Trump. He stopped developing emotionally around age 3-4. And I'm not being hyperbolic. He's missing basic
@bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex ...emotional skills that develop and strengthen around age 5 and beyond. 
None of which excuses him or Vance or "incels" or anyone else who feels entitled to other people's bodies or wants to remove women's choices. But the lack of those fundamental emotional skills is where a lot of this authoritarian and fascist bullshit originates -- which should be extra motivation for the rest of us to fight them HARD...and, in the meantime, teach our children well.
@SteveClough @bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex It hurts my heart to call them weird though--because *I* am weird! It's a great word that I adopted decades ago in response to being made fun of for being weird. I leaned into it and repurposed it and made it mine. Using it to describe the fascism-mongers--well, that word is just too good for them! ðŸ˜†
But I realize this is just me. I do agree 100% that we *must* laugh at them. I prefer calling them "warped," but that probably doesn't hurt them enough.
@SteveClough @bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex It helps for the public mockery. I'm still a weirdo at home though. ðŸ˜†ðŸ¤˜ðŸ––
@SteveClough When it comes right down to it, I'm just having a minor pity party because I don't want "my" word used for THEM. If it becomes the going thing though, I can find something else that works for me. Maybe I'll go with "wyrde," which would be suitably eccentric for this language nerd. ðŸ˜†
@arrrg Agreed 100%.
@DebR @bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex I don't doubt it. It doesn't excuse him, but it does explain a lot of things. He most definitely has not done the work as an adult.
@pooserville All very well said. And your intensity of self-reflection is a quality sorely lacking in many of us. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ––
@Nonilex
@ToddPM @Nonilex I used to be one of those people who thought that about atheists, so: CAN CONFIRM.
@sundiesel @Nonilex EXACTLY. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜
