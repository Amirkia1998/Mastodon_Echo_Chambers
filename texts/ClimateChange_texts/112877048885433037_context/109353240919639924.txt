@pooserville @courtcan @Nonilex I never understood the whole 'incel' nonsense... Just seems to be a bunch of whiny frat-boys who totally lack the self-awareness to realize that the reason they can't find anyone willing to shag them is because they're utterly self-absorbed, very stupid, probably neglect basic personal hygiene, and that most normal people could have a more insightful conversation with a ham sandwich.
@courtcan @pooserville @Nonilex I hear you. It doesn't seem even to be an ASD 'disconnect' thing (with which I might relate), it's more like 'I'm amazing, so everyone that doesn't understand that must be evil'. Maybe it really does come down to a kind of psychopathy...
