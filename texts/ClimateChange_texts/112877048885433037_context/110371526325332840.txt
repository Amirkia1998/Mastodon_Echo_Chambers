@courtcan @bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex Agreed. And it is no excuse - at least not for someone who wants to be in a position of authority. I think a lot of his followers have the same problems.

@courtcan @bytebro @pooserville @Nonilex If it helps - I am trying to use "Weirdo" which is more personal than just "being weird".
