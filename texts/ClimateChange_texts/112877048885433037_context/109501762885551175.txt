@courtcan @Nonilex I was a couple months shy of 50 when I married. When people asked me why it took me so long my explanation was "It took me that long to become someone worth marrying."
Marriage doesn't make men better; (many) women choose to marry better men. And what creeps like Vance hate is that women HAVE that choice â€” to wait for a man who's worth marrying, to leave a man who isn't right for them, or to eschew men entirely. Because they know that women who CAN choose won't choose them.
