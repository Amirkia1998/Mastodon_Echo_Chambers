1 #Vance fundraising email from Aug 2021:“…I needed to speak DIRECTLY to patriots like you about the serious issue of #radical #childless leaders in this country. We can’t have people who don’t have a direct stake in this country making our most important decisions.“We’ve allowed ourselves to be dominated by childless #sociopaths - they’re invested in NOTHING because they’re not invested in this country’s children. Fighting back won’t be easy - our childless opponents have a lot of free time…”
Another #JDVance fundraising email reads, “Our country is basically run by #childless Democrats who are miserable in their own lives & want to make the rest of the country miserable too… What I want to know is: why have we turned our country over to people who don’t have a direct stake in it?”

…In a 2019 speech, #JDVance articulated his belief in the positive impact that children have on society & individual lives. He explained that many of his views on children & society stem from observing how becoming a father can transform young men from being “driftless” to becoming “rooted” & “grounded” members of society.

“I care about declining fertility because I’ve seen the role of fatherhood, the positive role that it can play in the lives of my friends & in my community,” #JDVance said…
“I’ve seen people who become more attached to their communities, to thei  families, to their country because they have children,” #Vance added.… “we should care about declining fertility, not just because it’s bad for our economy, but because we think babies are good & we think babies are good because we’re not #sociopaths.”
Speaking of #AntiFamily, read these excerpts from #FredTrumpIII’s book 'All In The #Family; The Trumps & How We Got This Way' writing about discussions w/ #Trump after he stole Fred & #MaryTrump’s inheritance & Fred worried about caring for his differently abled child:
“When the reporter asked if he thought he might be coming across as just a little coldhearted, given our son's medical condition, my uncle shot back: 'I can't help that. It's cold when someone sues my father."

"'Those people…,' Donald said, trailing off. 'The shape they're in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.' I truly did not know what to say. He was talking about expenses. We were talking about human lives.”
“Donald took a second as if he was thinking about the whole situation. 'I don't know,' he finally said, letting out a sigh. 'He doesn't recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die & move down to Florida.'”
