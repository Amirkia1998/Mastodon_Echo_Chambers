@Nonilex Let's not forget what is underlying this: the billionaires want the birth rate to go back up without reversing 4 decades of wealth redistribution. 
Even if those incels weren't assholes, fewer young people can afford to raise children. Those birth rates aren't going back up unless and until the wealthy give up some of their hoard.
