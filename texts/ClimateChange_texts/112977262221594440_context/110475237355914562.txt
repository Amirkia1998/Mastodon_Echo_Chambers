@vegafjord @breadandcircuses ...Which is exactly why humanity is sleep-walking toward its own arguably deserved destruction.
@vegafjord Essentially what you're talking about is the importance of language in forming how we think. This is completely correct of course. Some have even suggested language is a symbiotic virus...but I digress. Rest assured the Powers That Be are quite familiar with these concepts, and have employed them against the concept you're discussing.
If not read, may I suggest Noam Chomsky's "Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies." https://www.amazon.com/Necessary-Illusions-Thought-Democratic-Societies/dp/0887845746
