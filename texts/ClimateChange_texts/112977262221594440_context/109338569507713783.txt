@breadandcircuses Surely.
The funny part is option A wouldn’t need nearly as much to yield great benefit. Option B is that expensive because of the “profit” made along the way, of each link in the supply chain. That’s the illusion of the economic order, that its choices are efficient (and of course do anything like maximizing “good”).
Those supply chains exist because they’ve found a way to pour oil, people etc on them and get money out. It’s intrinsically wasteful.

Funny how that 7 trillion largely goes to their interests. This is called efficient allocation of resources.
