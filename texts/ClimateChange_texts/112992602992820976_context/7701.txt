@yeri WTH. All that burned fuel, all that hassle for customer support and expenses to compensate. 
Gotta keep those slots, amirite? 🤷‍♂️
@yeri Think they’re time slots, when you miss one, you pay a fine or risk loosing that slot. Miss a few, loose your landing permit and thus market share.
Slots are also greatly sought after, I guess, if one company won’t use it, airports don’t fuck around and sell those to other airlines that will pay (even more) for them.
@yeri true, you’d think that. But guess capitalism gets in the way 😄
