@breadandcircuses Unfortunately, what Naomi Klein - & George Monbiot - don't understand is that contraction in the use of economic resources implies contraction of population, if their desire to see social justice & greater equality is to be respected.
@aumalatj @breadandcircuses Efficiency is about achieving maximum output for minimum input, but has nothing to say about what that output is, or what it's intended to do. It certainly has nothing to do with the basic fact of ever-increasing consumption of resources & energy on a finite planet. The Jevons Paradox tells us that improving energy efficiency actually increases energy consumption in a capitalist economy, rather than reducing it, because it allows for increased revenue & profits.
@aumalatj @breadandcircuses No more do I - but this does not contradict what I had to say about the finitude of resources. We have a global capitalist economy, not an ideal one, run on eco-socialist lines, & that economy is far more likely to lapse back into feudalism after sanguinary catastrophe than be replaced by any sort of Utopia.
