@breadandcircuses Brief reminder:
We cannot fix ecological problems by changing economic systems. The USSR and communist China were far bigger polluters than the US during the Cold War.
No matter what economic system you use, you still have to spend time and energy convincing stupid people in charge to listen to the experts.
