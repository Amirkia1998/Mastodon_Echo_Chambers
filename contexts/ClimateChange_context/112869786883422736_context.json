I prefer a more mathy view: they campaign in one-place predicates and govern in two-place predicates. </p><p>By this I mean you hear politicians say \"I like the environment.\" and \"I like schools.\" and \"I like families.\" One-place predicates. \"Do you like X?\" There is only one variable. Who would deny liking X? There are lots of X's that politicians are for. They call these their values, but it really says nothing about their values. It's easy to like everything.</p><p>Two-place predicates involve two variables. Do you like X more than Y. Politicians hate these. They don't want to say, at least not before being elected, that they like X more than Y or Y more than X. Oh, sure, they're both pro-gun and pro-safety-of-kids-at-school but try to get them to say \"If push comes to shove, it's more important to be pro-gun than it is to be pro-safety-of-kids-at-school.\" You won't pin them on that. They'll want you to think they can do everything. BUT all legislation inevitably trades these off.</p><p>So, and I'm sorry for being so roundabout in getting here, we end up with politicians who both favor the economy and favor climate, not politicians that are willing to say that if push comes to shove, the economy may need to suffer a bit. They are unwilling to be the bearer of bad tidings. </p><p>And in the end, they make a bet with the devil that somehow they will be less likely to be found out about shortchanging climate than about shortchanging economy. Traditionally, that has been a good bet for them, though it has sold out the future. Eventually it will not be a good bet, but it will be too late to fix it.</p><p>They have been unwilling to even just stand before the people and say \"I'm favoring the economy, because you won't elect politicians that don't. But we're going to end up dead because of this. Your kids will not grow up in a habitable world. I'll do what you say, but you need to say different.\" They don't even have THAT much courage, which would still let them do what they are doing but at least be honest.</p><p>So when I hear talk of \"energy self-sufficiency\" I hear that we're going to be a net-exporter of oil. That's no good. We shouldn't be producing oil, and probably someone else will, so while we are getting rid of oil use, we should just use up what's out there, not invest in finding more. But that will not be energy-independent.</p><p>When I hear that people will find me cost-efficient climate-friendly solutions that sacrifice some effectiveness for price, which says they won't be going fast. Eventually, it would be cost-effective because when the cost of using oil is that the world is crumbling, people will pay their last dollar for it not to be crumbling and call it cost-effective. But in the nearterm, we still subsidize oil production as a society and we still permit environmental externalities.</p><p>When we say we're worried about lowering gas costs without saying that will mean more gas use which means faster climate change, we are not telling the public what they are doing. Again, by itself, lower costs sounds great. But unless it's tied to other variables, it's a useless bit of information.</p><p>We have to change the conversation, to insist that these things be discussed in a linked way, not just as broken promises, but as promises we have set ourselves up to break, that we have asked politicians to break.</p><p>Politicians know that when we ask for too much, we are giving them free license to do whatever they want. That's how they operate. We need to ask for less of politicians and insist they really do it. </p><p>We need to be not so self-focused if we care even an iota about our kids and grandkids.</p><p>The hypocrisy is us, not just the evil government. It's how we talk about it, and it's what we aspire to.</p><p>Things have to change. It's the change we fear. We can't do things the way we always did. We have to talk about that as an actual thing. We want to do better without doing different.</p><p>\"Better implies different\"<br> --Amar Bose</p><p><a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/climate\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>climate</span></a> <a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/ClimateDenial\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>ClimateDenial</span></a> <a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/politics\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>politics</span></a> <a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/communication\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>communication</span></a> <a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/media\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>media</span></a> <a href=\"https://climatejustice.social/tags/journalism\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>journalism</span></a></p>",
