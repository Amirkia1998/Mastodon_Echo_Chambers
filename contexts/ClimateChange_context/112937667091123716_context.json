OK, mainly because they're bigger than one person needs, but I'd really struggle to buy a smaller Tesla, if they ever bother. Are they on again, or still off the table in favour of robotaxis?</p><p>That struggle would be 100% due to Mad Musk. I can't bolster the fortune of one of the most loudly and proudly odious men on the planet. A pity, because Tesla showed the world that EVs could replace ICE.</p>",
